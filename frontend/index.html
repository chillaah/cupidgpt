        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Why is the study being conducted?</h3>
          This research project is being undertaken as part of a study by Dr. Alan Woodley and Chiran Walisundara.<br>
          Imagine you are on a TV dating show. You stand on one side of a curtain and ask possible suitors some questions.<br>
          After hearing their answers, you have to choose which suitor you'd like to go on a date with.<br>
          However, one of the suitors is an AI machine. Do you think you could tell the difference?<br>
          The purpose of this project is to see how many people can distinguish between a human and a machine.

        &nbsp;
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What does participation involve?</h3>
          There are two ways to participate:<br>
          1. Answer typical ‘first-date’ type questions, like “Describe your idea of a perfect date.”<br>
          2. Read two prepared answers for a single question and compare them. Decide which answer is the most romantic or fun and identify which was written by a human or AI.<br>
          Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without penalty.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the possible benefits for me if I take part?</h3>
          This research is unlikely to benefit you directly.<br>
          However, it may benefit society by highlighting if people are susceptible to romance scams.

        &nbsp;
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the possible risks for me if I take part?</h3>
          There are no risks beyond normal day-to-day living associated with this project.
