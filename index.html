          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This research project is being undertaken as part of a study by Dr. Alan Woodley and Chiran Walisundara.<br>
            Imagine you are on a TV dating show. You stand on one side of a curtain and ask possible suitors some questions.<br>
            After hearing their answers, you have to choose which suitor you'd like to go on a date with.<br>
            However, one of the suitors is an AI machine. Do you think you could tell the difference?<br>
            The purpose of this project is to see how many people can distinguish between a human and a machine.

            <span class="arrow">▶️</span> What does participation involve?
          </h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            There are two ways to participate:<br>
            1. Answer typical ‘first-date’ type questions, like “Describe your idea of a perfect date.”<br>
            2. Read two prepared answers for a single question and compare them. Decide which answer is the most romantic or fun and identify which was written by a human or AI.<br>
            Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without penalty.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            This research is unlikely to benefit you directly.<br>
            However, it may benefit society by highlighting if people are susceptible to romance scams.
